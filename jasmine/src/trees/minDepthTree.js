 * Find Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree
 * Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from root node down to the nearest leaf node.
 *
 * For example, minimum height of below Binary Tree is 2.
 * Example Tree
 *
 * Note that the path must end on a leaf node. For example, minimum height of below Binary Tree is also 2.
